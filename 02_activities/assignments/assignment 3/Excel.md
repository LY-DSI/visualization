# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontario’s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words**

I utilized Microsoft Excel 365 to analyze and visualize the Toronto Beaches Water Quality dataset, chosen for its accessibility and robust data analysis features. The intended audience includes public health officials, city planners, environmental scientists, and community members interested in monitoring beach water quality. The visualization aims to highlight temporal trends in E. coli levels at Toronto beaches, providing insights into water quality over the months and years.

Design considerations focused on clarity and accessibility: a line plot was employed to depict trends over time, with labeled axes and gridlines enhancing readability. High-contrast colors and clear labeling were used to accommodate viewers with visual impairments, and standard fonts ensured compatibility with assistive technologies. Design considerations included a traffic light color scheme—red indicating unsafe conditions. To ensure reproducibility, raw data was preserved separately.

The analysis impacts various communities, including families planning beach visits, tourism operators near high-risk beaches, environmental advocacy groups, and lifeguard unions advocating for safer conditions. Feature selection focused on E. coli counts, dates, and beach names, while excluding less relevant data to maintain a clear and focused analysis. The 'underwater labour' involved data cleaning, handling missing values, debugging date formats, and testing multiple chart types to achieve clarity in data presentation.
