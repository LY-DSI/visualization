# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      A good example: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/
      
      The ‚ÄúVisualized: The World‚Äôs Population at 8 Billion‚Äù by Visual Capitalist clearly communicates complex demographic data through strong design choices, aligning with key data visualization principles.

      The visualization uses size-based circles to represent each country‚Äôs population, leveraging preattentive attributes (like area differences) for quick comparisons. Organized from largest to smallest, the layout creates a clear visual hierarchy and reduces cognitive load. A limited color palette‚Äîblue for countries, gold for continents‚Äîkeeps the design clean and emphasizes groupings without distraction. Direct labeling within circles removes the need for a legend, improving efficiency and accessibility.

      Contextual benchmarks (e.g., ‚ÄúChina = 1.43B‚Äù) provide useful reference points, while a small global map inset reinforces geographic distribution, minimizing potential spatial confusion. Importantly, the use of proportional area encoding maintains data integrity, avoiding distortions common with pie charts or 3D graphics.

Importantly, the use of proportional area encoding maintains data integrity, avoiding distortions common with pie charts or 3D graphics.

      Following Tufte‚Äôs principle of maximizing the "data-ink ratio," the minimalist design eliminates unnecessary elements, ensuring that visual emphasis stays on the data itself. If interactive features are available, they would further enhance user engagement and allow deeper exploration.

      Overall, the visualization prioritizes clarity, accuracy, and audience-friendly design, making it a strong example of effective and ethical data communication.

      A bad example: Source: https://iibawards-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads%2F1410773546066-gji78q6pnl8fr-ba8214368d58b7250a54456d3ca4b33e%2FStibo-3D-blocks.mp4

      This 3D bar chart from Stibo Systems is a poor example of effective data visualization due to several design flaws.

      First, the 3D perspective distorts the data, making it difficult to accurately compare bar heights. As Tufte (1983) warns in The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, unnecessary 3D effects add "chartjunk" that obscures meaning rather than clarifying it. Many bars are partially hidden behind others, forcing viewers to guess values, which violates principles of clear and immediate comprehension (Few, 2009).

      Second, the axes are confusing. It‚Äôs unclear how "Brands" and "Item Types" relate along the x- and z-axes, increasing cognitive load and interpretation difficulty (Knaflic, 2015). Effective visualizations should make relationships between variables obvious at a glance.

      Third, the color scheme is visually consistent but functionally weak. It doesn‚Äôt aid in grouping or distinguishing data categories, missing an opportunity to enhance clarity through color.

      Finally, the interactive elements suggested by the X, Y, and Z controls imply users must rotate the chart to understand it. However, effective visualizations should be instantly understandable without interaction, especially for basic comparison.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      The visualization needs significant improvements for clarity and effectiveness.

      First, define a clear purpose and provide context. Add a descriptive title (e.g., "Market Share by Product Category (2023)") and label axes or categories explicitly (e.g., "X = Product A, Y = Product B"). Include a brief subtitle or footnote explaining the data source and methodology.

      Next, replace text lists with appropriate charts. For comparisons, use a bar chart to accurately represent values, such as bars for "Branch," "Vista," etc., with values labeled directly. For proportions, a pie chart works well for up to five categories, or a stacked bar chart. Avoid 3D effects, which can distort data.

      To enhance clarity, use visual encoding effectively. Assign distinct colors to categories (e.g., blue for "Branch," orange for "Vista") and include a legend. Ensure bars are aligned for easy comparison and highlight key data using bold or contrasting colors.

      Improve the layout by using a single-column design, positioning the chart centrally with labels next to it. Group related data logically, such as clustering "Branch," "Vista," and "Dress" under a common category like "Apparel."

      Lastly, add data integrity by including exact values, percentages, or counts (e.g., "Branch: 24%") and citing the data source.
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
